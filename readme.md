# Diablo 4 Data Files

These are files that are pulled from the game and parsed into json. Focus will initially be on gathering assets for web applications to support community projects (such as skill planners, which is my first project goal).

All parsing code is open source and written by the community, but all direct game assets remain property of Blizzard. Please consult their terms of service before they throw lawyers at you :)

Texture assets (work in progress): https://files.blizzhackers.dev/d4tex/

# Field Notes

DT_SNO and DT_SNONAME fields are file references exclusively.

DT_GBID is a reference to a specific array element in a game balance file.
